1. Mix flour and salt in deep bowl. Create a space in the centre and mix in the eggs and water. Use hands (sticky) or spoon to mix.
2. Make into a ball and knead on a surface with floor until smooth, about 10mins. 
3. Use the pizza cutter to slice out small pieces about a large fishball size.
4. Use the rolling pin to completely flatten it.
5. Cut it to the size that you want with the pizza cutter. Add some flour so that the noodles don't stick to one another.

7. (For storage, can put a lot of flour and put in a broad container and can keep in fridge or freezer)
