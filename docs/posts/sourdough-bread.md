The delicious sourdough bread

<!-- more -->

1. Day -2
2. Start with a clean sterile bottle, measure the weight of the bottle and cover and label it on the bottle. 
3. Put 1 tbsp of starter in the bottle.
4. Add 50g of room temperature water. 
5. Add 50g of flour.
6. Mix it up so that there are no dry bits. 
7. Place the rubber band at the level of mix.
8. Day -1
9. The starter should more than double in size.
10. Add 300g of water to the mixing bowl
11. Wet a spoon so it doesn't stick, then add 100g of sourdough starter. You can keep the bottle with the starter for the next time.
12. Add 450g of flour. 
13. Add 10g of salt.
14. Mix everything with a wooden spoon or bowl scraper.
15. This is the start of bulk fermentation. Cover it and wait for 30mins.
16. First stretch and fold: Take the edge then stretch it as far as possible, and stick it over the opposite side. Do around 2-3x around the dough. Cover and wait for 30mins.
17. Second stretch and fold: As above and go one round around the dough. Be more gentle. Cover and wait another 30mins.
18. Then do a third stretch and fold and be even more gentle. Cover it up, and rest for another 3.5 hours. A total of 5 hours is recommended.
19. Pre-shape the dough. This recipe uses the oval shape. Flour the counter. Stretch and fold to remove the dough carefully from the bowl with the seam side up and put on the counter.
20. Stretch and fold until it kind of looks like a round ball. Then flip it around, so its seam side down and put on a clean part of the table. Then clear all the extra flour.
21. Create some tension in the dough by cupping, pulling and rounding it towards you on all the edges. Then let it rest for 30mins.
22. Grab a proofing basket, then sprinkle course flour on it, like rice flour, or just flour will do to prevent it from sticking. 
23. After the 30mins, flour the top of the dough then flip it over on the counter. Then form it into a rectangle, then fold one side somewhat over the middle, then take the other side and fold it over the centre, and press down the seam in the centre.
24. Then take the short edge to tuck and roll. Take the top, tuck it over and roll and keep tucking and rolling the dough to create tension. Now we have the shape.
25. Can take the short edge again, take the edge and tuck it underneath. And do the same for the other short edge. These help to create a lot of tension over the top.
26. Flip the dough over so that it is seam side up and put it inside the proofing basket.
27. Put it inside the fridge to let it proof overnight. No need to cover.
28. Day 0
29. 30 mins before you want to bake. Preheat at 260 degrees Celcius with the dutch oven inside.
30. Transfer the dough over to a parchment paper slightly bigger than your dough. Carefully flip it over, so that it is the seam side down. Brush down all the extra flour with a brush or hand.
31. Score the dough. Use a sharp blade.  Cut at an angle about 1cm along the long side.
32. Take the dutch oven out, put the dough with the paper inside, cover it and bake for 20mins.
33. Take the lid off, continue baking for another 15mins. If you like darker, then can cook longer.
34. You can cut it after a few hours.
