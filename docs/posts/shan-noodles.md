This is a super complicated Myanmar Shan Noodles, made by the northern folks.
<!-- more -->
1. Marinate the pork according to the ingredient list, preferably overnight, but a few hours will work too. 
2. Prepare all the things in the sauce and place each part on its own bowl.
3. Prepare the meat -- base and minced / blend them.
4. Fry the base with some oil and make them smell nice, I think it takes about 15 minutes in medium fire.
5. Add in the chopped tomatoes.
6. Add in the pork that has been marinated.
7. Add 1 tsp of sugar and some hot water till it is all submerged and cook under medium heat for 10mins.
8. In the mean time, start some boiling water, put in a bit of salt, maybe 1 tsp for 1 litres. Then when it is boiled, boil the Bok Choy till its is soft and take out.
9. Then boil the rice noodles till your desired texture.
10. When the rice noodles is ready, add the cooked meat, then a little of each of the sauce as you like.
11. Add in the bok choy, green onion, some sweet soy sauce 1 tsp and the shan fermented mustard. 
12. Mix and taste to your desire and enjoy!
