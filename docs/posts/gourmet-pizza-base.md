For that super crispy and nice special pizza base they sell at restaurants.

1. Mix warm water at 40.5 degree Celsius, honey and salt in a small bowl. Sprinkle the yeast on top. Let it sit for 5 mins before stirring.  
2. Put the flour in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre of the flour and pour in the yeast mixture. Slowly stir with a spoon. Knead by hand 2 mins. (Will be sticky)
3. Cover with plastic till airtight. Leave it at room temperature and watch it grow. About double the size, or up to you. Takes about 4-5 hours.
4. Transfer to floured surface, coat lightly in flour. Divide in half or the size you want. 
5. Fold it in half 8 times, like closing a book then rotate then repeat. At the last fold, close all the seams and leave on table on that folded side. 
6. Form into a ball in hands and put in a lightly oiled bowl, cover and refrigerate 18 hours up to a week. 
7. Before using, bring it out and let it relax at room temperature 1 hour. Preheat oven at 280 degrees celsius.
8. When ready, transfer one dough to floured surface, turning to gently coat in floor. Pat centre of dough gently with fingertips.
9. Lift the dough over both knuckles and roll under the centre of dough, working outwards. Leave a thicker crust at the edge. Make about 10 to 12 inch pizza. Make it slightly bigger as it will shrink.
10. Apply layer of [red base](/posts/tomato-sauce-or-pasta-alla-pamarola.html) or [/posts/white base](white-pizza-sauce.html). [Top the pizza](/posts/pizza-toppings.html) and put in pizza stone and bake for 8-10 mins or until crust is golden brown.
