Make your own nice pizza base.
<!-- more -->
1. Mix 1 1/3 cups warm water at 40 degree Celsius and sugar in a bowl. Sprinkle the yeast on top. 
2. Set aside until foamy, about 10 mins then stir in the olive oil.
3. Whisk the flour and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre of the flour and pour in the yeast mixture. Slowly stir with a spoon.
4. Put on a flour powdered surface. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 5mins.
5. Cut into the desired size. About 2 balls for large pizza, about 6 to 8 for mini pizza.
6. Coat the balls with oil.
7. Put in a large basin then cover with cling wrap tightly.
8. Leave it at room temperature and watch it grow. About double the size, or up to you. Takes about 1 and half hours to 2 hours.
9. Take out one ball, and coat with oil. Then roll it out with a pin for a flat crispy pizza or stretch it out into a nice fluffy pizza.
10. Keep in fridge to stop it from growing. Or freeze up to 1 month in a cling wrap.
