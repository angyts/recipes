For that delicious square japanese eggs.

<!-- more -->

1. Break the eggs into a bowl, add all the ingredients and mix with a fork.
2. Start fire with small or low medium fire.
3. Apply a little olive oil on the pan with an oiled kitchen paper.
4. Gently pour a third of the mixture in and press out the air bubbles.
5. Use a pair of chopsticks to fold the egg when it is hardened.
6. When it is folded, push it to the top again. Then pour in another third of the mixture.
7. Lift up the cooked egg to allow the mixture to flow below it.

8﻿. Repeat the same with the rest of the mixture.
9﻿. You can just eat it like this, or can cut into strips to put into nori.

N﻿otes: If there is more soy sauce or brown sugar or more cooked or if the fire is too big, it can caramelise a little and become a little dark in colour.
