2. Preheat oven oven to 230 deg C or 200 deg C with convection.
3. Boil 2L of water with 2 tbsp salt and 1/2 tsp baking soda. Bring the potatoes to boil from cold. After boil, simmer for about 10 mins or until the potatoes are soft and can cut through.
4. In the meantime, gently fry the oil (preferably animal oil) with the garlic, rosemary and black pepper. Cook till garlic is brown, and strain the oil. 
5. Rough them up a bit so there is a layer of potato paste around it.
6. Put the oil and a little salt and pepper and put on the baking tray. Apply layer of oil around the potatoes.
7﻿. Bake for about 20mins. Then take them out, flip them, then cook for another 30mins. Can move them ones to cook evenly.

N﻿otes: Removing the skin can make them more crispy. Cutting to smaller pieces can make it harder and more crispy.
