This very special Myanmar Chinese dish, unforgettable.
<!-- more -->
There are quite a lot of steps to this dish, but once you get the hang of it, it gets quite easy.

1. You first need to Barbecue the brinjal. Apparently back in Myanmar, they used to throw it in the charcoal fire. But where can we find fire in a modern house?

2. Cook (I like to call it burn) it over a medium hot fire, directly. Cook until you don't see anymore purple, just black burnt skin, and you will smell the burnt smell. It should look something like this after you are done.

3. Leave it to cool for a while and go prepare the other stuff like mince the garlic and slice the pork. After it cools down, run it along a little water stream, and peel away all the skin till it looks something white like the image above on the ingredient platter.
4. Shred the brinjal like so. Use a fork to pull all the strands apart. Then cut it into half, then remove the "head".

5. Put at least 7 tbsp of oil and start a medium high fire in a wok or frying pan. It's a Myanmar dish, it probably works with with even more oil. At the same time, preheat the oven to 220 deg celsius.
6. Fry the onions till it is a little brown and smells nice.
7. Fry the minced garlic until golden brown about 10 seconds.
8. Put in the pork and fry until it is all cooked and tender, about 3-5 mins.
9. Put in the prawn and fry till it is orange, about 1-2 mins.
10. Put in the brinjal and fry until the whole thing is a big ball, and oil starts to sizzle. It should also become rather dry and sticky.
11. Season with 1 tsp dark soy sauce, then 1.5 to 2 tbsp of light soy sauce, can increase as per your taste and preference. Put in the white pepper last.
12. Turn up to maximum fire for 10 seconds then turn off the fire.
13. Pour in the eggs, quickly and continue stirring till everything is mixed well.
14. Put on a oven safe plate, then cook in oven for 20 mins at 220 deg celsius.
