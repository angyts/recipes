For that crazy spicy fried rice.
<!-- more -->
1. Pound all the base ingredients with a mortar and pestle or food processor.
2. Fry all the anchovies. You can remove the head and the gills and wash them, or not before. Put on kitchen towel to dry them.
3. Fry the base gently until caramelised. Then remove.
4. Stir fry the chicken until cooked. Then remove.
5. Put a bit of oil, crank up the heat. Fry the eggs and scramble them. 
6. When half fried, throw all the rice in and keep smashing the rice. Mix back the chicken and the base and the vegetables.
7. Season with seasoning ingredients and dry until wok hey. (Season with tamarind water if want sour.)
