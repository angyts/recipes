These are mini tiny crispy super nice chocolately cookies.

<!-- more -->

1. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, salt and baking soda.
2. In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar until fluffy. Beat in the egg and vanila extract. 
3. Slowly blend in the flour and then chocolate chips and mix nicely. 
4. Use a small 1/2 teaspoon and thin bread knife to scoop out and put on the baking tray.
5. Space them out by 1.5 cm each.
6. Bake at 180 degrees, with convection fan on.
7. Need to watch very very closely. They burn very easily.
8. When I cook 3 trays together they can take about 7-8 minutes.
9. Sometimes when the oven is very hot and only one tray, it can take only 5 minutes.
