Japanese Ramen or Soup Noodles. 

<!-- more -->

1. Heat sesame oil over low heat and add minced garlic, ginger and onion. Fry until fragrant.
2. Add spicy bean paste and miso. Blend quickly. (Can add minced meat at this stage.)
3. Add in the ground sesame seeds and sugar.
4. Add sake (and chicken stock -- Optional).
5. Put in the pork ribs and add almost a full pot of water if there is no stock, bring to a boil before simmering it. (Can add in bamboo shoots too.)
6. Simmer for 2 hours until the soup is thick. Can be up to 2.5 hours for extra soft.
7. Add in the white pepper, miso and tsuyu dashi till it tastes nice.
8. Bring plain water to boil in another pot, cook ramen noodles for a minute or according to instructions.
9. Add the soup to the freshly cooked noodles in a large serving bowl. Add the pork ribs and bamboo shoots to the side. 
10. (Optional: Add [Ramen Eggs](https://recipes.punggolgp.com/posts/japanese-ramen-egg-or-ajitsuke-tamago.html) or [Poached Eggs](https://recipes.punggolgp.com/posts/poached-eggs.html), nori/seaweed, frozen/canned corn, green onion, spring onions, shiraga negi <- children hate this.)

Notes: 
It is much better to cook from scratch, the stock base has way too much MSG already baked inside it.
