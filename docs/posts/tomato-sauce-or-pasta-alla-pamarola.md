My favourite tomato sauce.
<!-- more -->
1. Prepare all the ingredients. It can take a while to chop all the tomatoes, thinly sliced onions and mince garlic.
2. Grab the largest pot you can find in the house. Start with medium-high heat. Add a little olive oil and add onions.
3. Cook till soft and translucent or blond, about 15mins, don't let it burn.
4. Once onions are done, push to the side, add a little oil then cook the garlic, for about 20 seconds till it starts to brown.
5. Add in all the tomatoes and bring to boil then reduce to simmer. If using fresh tomatoes, smash them with the spatula. 
6. Add in salt and basil leaves / oregano if using.
7. According to the recipe, it says cook for 25-40 mins when the taste shifts from raw to cooked, but I'm not sure why I usually take about 90-120 mins to cook and dry it to a paste. Stir frequently to prevent burn. If burnt transfer to another pot.
8. When cooked, add in 175ml of olive oil and stir and remove from heat.
9. Puree the sauce with a blender then taste.
10. Keep in fridge for a week for freeze for up to 3 months.
11. Use it to cook pasta, pizza and many other other wonderful food.
