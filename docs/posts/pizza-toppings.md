Get some ideas for pizza toppings. 

<!-- more -->

Must stay disciplined, if there are too much ingredients, the base can become soggy and the pizza is not nice. 

C﻿an always put more red / white base, but cheese and ingredients have to be just nice.

I﻿ think max 5 things.

### Cheesy

Ingredients: White base, Mozzarella

### Super Cheesy

Ingredients: White base, Mozzarella, Cheddar

#﻿## Seafood

I﻿ngredients: 300gm small prawns or about 8-10 pieces --> butter garlic prawns, 1 tablespoon sun dried tomato pesto, 1 tablespoon basil pesto, diced sun dried tomatoes, 2 tsp crumbled feta, handful of fresh basil leaves

### Hawaiian

P﻿ossible ingredients: Red base, creamy Mozzarella, bacon, fresh pineapple, Ham, smoky bacon, Sweet red onion, Tangy barbecue sauce, spicy jalapenos, savory canadian bacon, juicy grilled chicken, zesty pepperoni, roasted red peppers, crispy prosciutto, sliced black olives, fragrant basil leaves, sharp parmesan cheese

1. Chop fresh pineapple into small cubes.
2. Boil with one tablespoon of sugar with a little water just enough to cover. Boil till soft.
3. Or put fresh ones, it seems to be less wet.
4﻿. Or use canned ones

### Pepperoni

Ingredients: Red base, Mozzarella, pepperoni/salami

### Supreme

Ingredients: Red base, mozzarella, bacon, onion, minced meat, capsicum, pepperoni, mushroom, olives

### BBQ

Ingredients: BBQ sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, bacon, sausage,  minced meat, ham

### Garlic butter prawns and chilli

Ingredients: Red base, mozzarella, garlic butter prawns, capsicum, onion, chilli

1. Have to half fry the prawns in butter and minced garlic, just a few mins, until it turns just slightly red.

### Sausage & Kale

Ingredients: Red base, mozzarella, sausage, kale

### Margherita

Ingredients: Red base, buffalo mozzarella, basil, olive oil, salt

Notes: Gouda is not a good replacement for Mozzarella, it has a odd thick taste.
