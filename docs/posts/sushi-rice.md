Basic Sushi Rice.

<!-- more -->

1. Cook 3 cups of short grain rice. The quality of the rice matters. The higher grade and more authentic japanese rice the better. Wash it twice and add twice the amount of water as rice.
2. Mix all the rice vinegar, sugar and salt together.

   It might need a little patience to make sure everything dissolves.

3. When rice is ready, moisten the rice bowl a little. 
4. Pour out all the rice and spread evenly.
5. Gradually pour all the vinaigrette over the rice.
6. Mix the rice with a slicing action. While mixing cool the rice with a strong fan/wind.
7. When rice is evenly mixed, it will become glossy. Cover with muslin cloth or shrink wrap and wait for it to cool a little.
